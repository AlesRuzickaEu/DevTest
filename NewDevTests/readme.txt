# Read me first

* Each file contains a test with task, sometimes with unit tests.
* For each test write code directly in given file, but you can write as many classes as you need.
* Some classes has tests, but follow instructions rather than tests. Tests are more like additional documentation. Some have no tests. You may write yours if it makes sense or just follow instructions.
* Write your own code - linking library or copy/paste is not what we want here
* Write comments where you are not sure, where you were thinking about multiple solutions, etc.
